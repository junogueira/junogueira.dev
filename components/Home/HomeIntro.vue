      Hey there!
    </h1>

    <p>
      I'm Ju, a software engineer and builder from Brazil. I've been building
      web applications and sites for the last 10+ years, and more recently, I've
      been specializing in the Javascript ecosystem with Vue.js, Nuxt &amp;
      Node.js.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, I work as a Full Stack Engineer at
      <NuxtLink external to="https://finoo.io/" class="underline"
        >Finoo</NuxtLink
      >, and in my free time, I'm always tinkering with some app or site that I
      am building, experimenting with SEO, or even designing a new project.
